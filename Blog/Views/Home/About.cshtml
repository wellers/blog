		<p>My name is Paul David Welbourne. I am an Application Developer based in Widnes, Cheshire. 
		Since graduating from the University of Liverpool in 2008, I have worked on many exciting 
		web-based projects with a number software development teams in-and-around the North-West UK.</p>        
		<p>I specialise in Microsoft .NET technologies, and have specific passion for Web development.</p>
		<p>I'm a practitioner of Agile software development, Test Driven Development and the adoption 
		of best practices and SOLID-compliance.</p>
		<p>Apart from my contributions here, you can also find me microblogging on 
		<a href="http://www.twitter.com/wellers">Twitter</a>.</p>
		<p>Outside of software development, I have casual interests in music production, sports and keeping fit at my local gym.</p>
